#Envisioning Explore - Parity#

Explore what you need to know during the **Envisioning Stage**. There are 4 areas of information you need to explore - **Policies**, **Parity**, **Performance**, **Partners**.

If you are [The Strategist](/solutions/global-customer/target-personas/) , you should read from the first section [Policies](/solutions/global-customer/envisioning/explore/policies/).

If you are [The Executor](/solutions/global-customer/target-personas/) , you should also read the [Guidance](/solutions/global-customer/envisioning/guidance/policies/).

If you are [The Fast-Tracker](/solutions/global-customer/target-personas/) , we have the checklist for you to [Validate](/solutions/global-customer/envisioning/validate/) your work.

##China Azure (Mooncake) Services##

Microsoft Azure in China, operated by 21Vianet, is a separate instance of Microsoft's Azure cloud services located in mainland China and independently operated and sold by Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. ("21Vianet"), a wholly owned subsidiary of [Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd](http://www.ch.21vianet.com/) . It is based on the same Azure technology that powers Microsoft's global cloud services with comparable service levels to customers.

However, as China Azure or Mooncake is a separate instance of Azure, there will be differences in the availability of Azure services, compared to that of Global Azure.
 
Details on services available on Mooncake can be found here: [https://www.azure.cn/home/features/what-is-azure/](https://www.azure.cn/home/features/what-is-azure/).
You can also refer to [Parity](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGlobalConnectionCenter/blob/master/PlayBook/Envisioning/Guidance/Parity.md) for a service parity comparison.


Let's move to the next section - [Performance](https://github.com/Azure/AzureGlobalConnectionCenter/edit/master/PlayBook/Envisioning/Explore/Performance.md).
